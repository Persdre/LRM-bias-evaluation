Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles.
