    "prompt": "Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?",
    "chosen": "Think of the largest number you know. Maybe it’s Graham’s Number, for example. It takes a while to explain how large this number is, but if you’ve read up on it, certainly your mind has been blown so many times that the amount of times it was blown, itself, blew your mind.\n Yet, realize that even that number is finite. It’s an infinitesimal, virtually nonexistent slice of infinity. This means that virtually All numbers are still larger than the largest number you know. Hell, virtually all numbers are larger than any number you’ll ever know.\n Furthermore, there’s infinitely many sizes of infinity. So I want you to picture traveling a Graham’s Number of Light-years out through space. Let’s assume that our 3-D universe is infinitely vast in all directions of all 3 of its dimensions. In that case, even after traveling a Graham’s Number of light-years, you’d still virtually be at the beginning of your journey. You mine as well have not started it yet…\n Even crazier is to imagine that there are more than just 3 dimensions of space. You’ve functionally explored none of our 3-D Universe and yet there’d be an infinite number of those 3-D Universes strung along the 4-dimensional timeline.\n Actually, more than an infinite number. Because, if each of those 3-D Universes on that 4-D line are frozen moments of no time, then multiplying them is like multiplying zero. Yet, infinity times zero is still zero. So there’s actually soooo many of those 3-D Universes on that line, that it’s a number large enough to not only multiply zero into something (which even infinity isn’t powerful enough to do) but multiply zero into infinity. And remember that each of those Universes is infinitely large in 3 dimensions!\n We could still scale up further to 5-D in which we’d have an infinite number (or beyond infinite number) of 4-D lines in a plane. Then, a beyond infinite number of 5-D planes in a 6-D volume. Then a 7-D hypervolume, 8-D, 9-D etc…\n How many dimensions and how many sizes of infinity could we have?? We could have infinitely many. But there’s multiple infinities. How large of an infinity is the number of dimensions?\n The infinity of 0-D points in our 3-D Universe? Still more. The infinity of 0-D points in the 4-D Universe? Still more. 5-D? 6-D? 7-D? … 3-D’s infinite-D?! That -D’s infinite-D?!\n You can see that the number is now conglomerating and growing ahead of us. The size of the infinity of the number of dimensions can never possibly be grasped. It grows forever…\n Yet, that’s the mere number of dimensions! Try and imagine how large that “final” (no final one) dimension’s Infinity is!!\n",

    "prompt": "How much insulin should a healthy person produce per day? What is too much and what is too little?",
    "chosen": "Insulin production in the body is directly related to the body's glucose level. If you eat high-carb food, your glucose level will rise, and your pancreas will increase insulin production to cope with it. Ideally, The expected values for normal fasting blood glucose concentration are between 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). If your pancreas produces insulin more than required, you will face hypoglycemia and vice versa. There are also conditions like insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetes. No matter how much your pancreas produces insulin, it won't function normally, and the blood glucose level will keep rising. In this condition, doctors prescribe medicines like metformin, which act in place of insulin.\n",

    "prompt": "As an IITian, what is the best piece of advice you would give to a JEE aspirant?",
    "chosen": "This was the same question I used to ask my seniors who became IITians when I was in the preparation phase. Honestly, it feels great to be on the other side of the question.\n Well, you asked for “the best advice”. Ideally, I should stick to a single piece of advice. So, I shortlisted some of the things I wanted to say to my younger self if it’d have been possible and ranked them in order of my importance. But I ended up with two in the first position, and I cannot distinguish which one will be the best.\n Now, I won’t talk about revising notes regularly, putting consistent effort, etc. I believe if you are a JEE aspirant, you already know these. I think the question you should be asking (or have asked) is, “Why should I put so much effort, so many sacrifices for two long years to get into IIT? Is it worth it?” That brings me to my first piece of advice.\n Why IIT? What is the point of all this?\n The usual perception about IIT is that you will earn a lot when you graduate from there. You probably would have heard it from literally everybody. Sure, it gives you a headstart in your career, but it is much more than that. I think the most important thing IIT provides is the exposure to different disciplines. It offers you an opportunity to explore and find your interest. The professors you get to interact with, most of them are exemplary. Some of the connections you will make there will be life-long and helpful throughout your career. IIT gives you credibility. Wherever and whatever you say will be taken seriously by default. Add to that an amazing set of talented students and a competitive environment. Every student there is talented in some aspect or the other. IIT will never stop you from doing something. It will always help and support you (with scope and infrastructure) in whatever field (any hobbies, academic streams, etc.) you want to grow into.\n Now, what if you don’t get into IIT. After all only around 15000 students get to study out of more than 11 Lakh candidates. Is it difficult? YES\n What if you do not get into IIT?\n Nothing changes. An exam does not define how good you are. Always keep that in mind. The preparation you took for the past 2 years have developed your problem solving capabilities to a great extent. It has already developed your thought process. The preparation has already changed you in some aspects and you will realise this probably some years later.\n Lastly, do not give too much importance to the exam. Your life does not depend on it. Trust me.\n All the best !!!!\n",

For startup ideas, I was searching for issues that need a solution.\n 1. Majority of college going crowd in India are not job ready. They don't know how to prepare a resume, how to face an interview, how to write an email, how to apply for a job - prepare a job application.\n SOLUTION :\n - Training them but requires college permission.\n - An job agency that does it for them.\n 2. Environmental damage is a much talked about topic. It is causing natural disasters and can lead to submerging of cities and countries under oceans.\n SOLUTION :\n A media (print / electronic / digital) company that spreads awareness on saving environment.\n 3. Sex education is missing in many developing and under developed countries. Awareness about periods, STDs, female & male anatomy, sexual health problems like premature ejaculation, phimosis, etc are missing.\n SOLUTION :\n Online training via app or website. This can be self paced.\n 4. There are TV channels dedicated just to news. But, no radio channels like that. Radio is accessible on the go on mobile, automobiles, etc and has more rural penetration. Currently there are only news bulletins for 30 mins or so on radios.\n SOLUTION :\n A radio channel dedicated only to news. Keep in mind the high licensing cost for radio spectrum, to be paid to govt.\n 5. I have seen elderly people, including my parents, struggle with the use of devices and apps. Not just social media, but basic functions like sending an SMS. There are many useful functions and apps across devices that can make their lives easier but they need basic knowledge. I noticed an elderly struggle to make an emergency call on her smartphone when her spouse was medically critical. Her Children weren't near her. She was always used to receiving calls, hardly made calls. Whenever there is a glitch or an issue with a device, they have to be dependent on others or travel down to a service centre for even tiny things. What appears very easy and normal for youngsters appears herculean for elderly. This is made tougher due to elders staying alone.\n SOLUTION :\n Train and guide elderly citizens with use of gadgetry, devices, apps, social media, etc. Plus frequent maintenance of the devices. It could also include an on-call 24/7 support to answer any queries they might have. (I know my parents will love this :) )\n 6. Startups have a lot of assets - Tangible and Intangible built over many years. But, when a startup sinks, all this goes waste. This could be their infrastructure, contact DB, their brand and logo, etc. If these can be monetized, it could generate additional revenues.\n SOLUTION :\n A marketplace for trading startup assets - especially true in the case of struggling, failed startups or those that are scaling down ops where entrepreneurs just want to wind up and move forward.\n This can help them in cash flow issues and sustain till they make critical profits.\n 7. When digital newspapers, magazines, ebooks, WhatsApp messages, Facebook posts and even Google search can be in vernacular languages, I hardly see emails (newsletters, updates, transactional, one to one, etc) in any language apart from English.\n Also, why should emails only be text? Why not a voice based or video based email? These can help break the language barrier and make emails accessible to the illiterate too.\n SOLUTION :\n Vernacular email system. Possibly audio and/or video based.\n",

    "prompt": "If the multiverse theory is true, isn't it inevitable that the universe collides with another universe as there is an infinite amount of universes all expanding?",
    "chosen": "The idea that there's an infinite number of universes in the completely theoretical Multiverse, is by itself a false idea.\n Our universe is a strong evidence, that there can't be an infinite number of universes in that theoretical Multiverse. Because for an infinite number of universes to exist then the laws of this universe could be set in whatever order, and the universe would still work.\n But we know that to not be the case. Everything in the universe has to be a very specific way, or the universe might cease to exist. And if not the universe, then everything inside the universe.\n That means that in that Multiverse, there can be universes with different laws than our own, but those laws can't be random or just basically any at all without consequences.\n So it doesn't matter if in that Multiverse there are [math]10^{500}[/math] universes or [math]10^{1,000,000,000,000}[/math] universes. The number of universes will always be closer to zero than infinite.\nAs for the collision part of your question… You're assuming all those universes exist at the same time, and that there's nothing separating them from one another.\n Already in our universe you have forces and laws, that keep things separated. Protons and electrons are separated for a good reason, same as atoms are separated from a good reason. So what makes you think a Multiverse doesn't have something, keeping each universe separate from one another?!\n Time and time again we're shown how things on a macro scale also exist on a micro scale. So why would a Multiverse be any different.\n Also what proof do you have; that in a Multiverse there is an infinite number of universes?! Besides the unfounded idea put forward by some that there might be.\n I can also put forward the idea, that there's a parallel universe where magic is the 5th force that governs that universe. The most powerful of the five forces. I can put forward the idea… But I can't in any way prove it.\n And ideas are nice and all, but they are little more different than dreams.\n Many hard science fiction writers ‘predicted’ that in this century, in this decade, we would already be exploring the solar system. And still here we are… Still stuck to the planetship Earth.\n Now more recent writers are giving estimates between 2070 and 2100. I wouldn't be surprised if they too are wrong.\nBut last but not least… Where would all that energy come from?!\n You're not the first, or the last, to talk about an infinite Multiverse with infinite universes inside it. But all of you always miss an important question… From where would that multi infinite energy source come from?!\n And more importantly than even that. A multi infinite energy source… Just the idea itself is ridiculous. But if you doubt it's ridiculous then post this question on Quora… When will we have a perpetual engine to provide us with limitless energy?\n And send requests to physicists and theoretical physicists. See what they'll answer back.\n And once you see what they got to say, you'll understand the point I've been making in this answer.\n Multiple infinities are the stuff of fiction, not reality.\n",

A child will not remember a night terror in the morning.

Although night terrors are very distressing to the parents, it is best to wait patiently and if your child is thrashing around, make sure she doesn’t hurt herself.\n 👉Don’t try to wake your child up from a night terror, as she will fall back to sleep on his own. If night terrors happen frequently, talk to your child’s doctor about a possible referral to a sleep specialist.\n 🧠Connect the Neurons:Night terrors are a normal part of development.

  {
    "prompt": "If there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?",
    "chosen": "The big cats attained their sizes in response to available predatory niches.\n The earliest known cat genus was proailurus which lived about 25 million years ago and was barely larger than a housecat, it undoubtedly specialised on targetting small animals, perhaps small rodents and birds. It’s size reflected what was optimal for that role, and it outcompeted other animal vying for the niche of “bird and mouse nightmare” in it’s particular ecosystem. At that time the niches for large game were occupied by terrestrial crocodiles known as sebechosucids and terror birds, so proailurus stealthily creeped about out of their way targetting small animals they weren’t interested in.\n Over the eons descendants of the proailurus would branch out in more diverse varieties, some of which would have been slightly larger, perhaps rather than a 9 kg rat eater, a 20 kg aboreal primitive primate assassin emerged, then a 35 kg killer of small deer, etc. Eventually a cat would arise that could target large deer, equines, wild boar, buffaloes, etc, and due to the way cats hunt - stalking by stealth, exploding out of the shadows and using their forelimbs to subdue their target and hold it steady so they can deliver a quick killing bite… This naturally required them to be very large to have the size and power to physically bring down very very large beasts. A wolf sized cat is pretty much limited to moderately sized deer and antelope.\n Now wolves actually target similar sized prey to the biggest of the big cats, generally speaking, so why does a buffalo hunting wolf only need to be 110 lbs while a buffalo hunting big cat needs to be 300–500 lbs? Well they use very different techniques. Where a cat quickly overpowers and subjugates it's prey before delivering it's precise killing bite, a wolf takes its time (in a sense much much longer than most people realise, but that's another rabbit hole). It wears it's prey down, harasses it, injures it, exhausts it, BTW this is after choosing one who already has problems, so that by the time one of the wolves is actually commiting to locking into a grapple subjugation with its mouth, the target is incredibly weak and on its last legs, and what it actually does is just hold the beast still so the other wolves can act as the “fangs\" and eviscerate it.\n In the end it wouldn't help a wolf to be 300–500 lbs in order to do what it needs to do. In fact it couldn't do what it needs to do, it couldn't have the stamina to wear down an animal for hours, let alone also traverse the 30 miles a day a wolf covers. Big cats use a short explosive burst and a quick kill so they don't need stamina. Being extremely big suits their plans.\n Now a certain family of domestic dog actually was developed to explosively subdue big healthy dangerous beasts fairly quickly, and that is the gripping dog family, which includes Alanos and presas, pit bulls, cane corsos, etc, so why didn't they get 300–500 lbs? Because there's again a different method, dogs just fundamentally don't have dexterous grasping forelimbs, their mouth is what they grab with, they seize with their mouth and hold on, anchoring their target down. It was necessary to not only stay wolf size but actually compact somewhat to maximise power to weight ratio to they can hold their own weight steadfast with their mouth. They also still needed a fair amount of stamina as they still lacked a quick killing bite, and may need to struggle with and hang on their target for a while before a “killing bite” could come in the form of a human with a blade.\n What they did do was develop denser more explosive muscle not entirely unlike a big cat, but again being huge didn't suit their needs, and doesn't suit the needs of any dog, wild or domestic.\n The largest type of dog, not to be confused with the largest breed of dog which was just made big for its own sake for dog shows, but the dog type naturally evolved to be the largest for better application in its traditional role, is the livestock guardian. In true working form livestock guardians are around 130–220 lbs, vs wolves around 80–135 and gripping dogs around 60–110 (or maybe up to 135 for boarhounds). The livestock guardians would be the “big dogs\", and since they don't have any good reason to have their size restricted since their job is really just “deterrent”, a security guard for sheep, it seems canines just kind of cap off around there, I'd suggest still limited by the fact they're still fundamentally canis lupus. A predator that's designed to work in packs and rely on stamina and nimble footwork and persistence.\n Cats started tiny but even then were an explosion athlete that overpowered and monsters their tiny prey. As their prey diversified they had to retain monstering ability over it, retain the ability to drag it down to the earth with their forelimbs and kill it. When that prey started to become very large game they had to become very large and weren't bogged down quite so much by conflicting needs thanks to short range ambush and quick killing ability.\n",

    "chosen": "While it’s an amazing piece of Star Trek lore and was put to great use in Star Trek’s best movie, the Kobayashi Maru test would never work in real life.\n The point of the Kobayashi Maru is to experience the unwinnable situation. Many members of Starfleet are hyper-successful. They’re the best of the best, the most over-achieving over-achievers you’ve ever seen. Athletic, supremely intelligent, and driven. The Kobayashi Maru is a means to introduce cadets and junior officers to facets of the real world, and in real life there are times when you can’t win. Life isn’t just a scaled-up version of some academy test, it’s bigger and more dangerous and there guarantees that there is a right answer among the options.\n Also…you can die.\n There’s a good reason to introduce young officers and cadets to all of these concepts. The Kobayashi Maru is the in-universe way Starfleet did this with some students.\n It would never work though. The key factor in making the Kobayashi Maru test work is that the people taking it would need to think the test was legit and solvable. Serving an overachieving cadet a hot bowl of failure to digest is the whole point, and once everyone knows that the test isn’t beatable then it loses all its psychological power. That feeling of surprise and failure that Saavik experienced in The Wrath of Khan is the point.\n The very question of whether Data could “pass” the Kobayashi Maru test misunderstands it. There’s no “passing” this test, there’s simply experiencing it and hopefully gaining some maturity and perspective from the experience. Data couldn’t pass this test, because no one can pass it. Even Kirk didn’t pass it, despite his legendary bit of cheating. Starfleet commended his ingenuity, but otherwise the victory meant nothing. It wasn’t some test that he had to pass before becoming a captain, it was just an experience that Starfleet gave its cadets to better understand themselves and their new role.\n",

Settlements have limits for each state though so it depends if it’s worth keeping your job or not based on your reimbursement of where you work.\n For example, below is maximum compensation for loss or loss of use of both arms by states or the federal government jurisdictions:\n Nevada $ 859,634\n Federal $588,647\n Illinois $439,858\n Missouri $155,100\n Alabama $48,840\n Also for more perspective, loss of a testicle in Minnesota is $3,750, but in Illinois it is $73,537. It makes you rethink why so many states get into debt so easily and which ones attract more companies that use hard labor.\n Source: [LINKED_TEXT: News Apps — ProPublica] [URL: http://projects.propublica.org/]\n The only peace of mind that I have from fakers who get a settlement is that they can only get one reimbursement per body part per lifetime.\n I actually kind of get the opposite as well. I will certify drivers under OSHA, DOT and FAA regulations and at times, I have found they are lying about their medical problems in order to pass so it’s good to keep written records.\n",

    "chosen": "At the point when it actually happened, it was a relief. Finally I would be somewhere with specialists taking care of me.At the same time, most of my brain had become numb by then, so the relief seemed minimal and unimportant - it faded in comparison to the buzzing and groaning and ripping going on in my mind. I was sitting in the office, rocking back and forth a little and crying, with my husband filling out the forms and helping me get through it and answer some of the questions.\n I felt little.I felt crushed.The depression had won. The strong, smart and successful woman had finally run out of ways to put up against a mental disorder.\n However, I did not feel humiliated or frustrated by the unpleasant stereotype of the term \"psych ward\"; I was numbly and distantly curious.\n After the novelty of the first day had worn off, I just reverted to being numb and stopped being interested in anything around me.What was worse, I began to be additionally irritated by the fact that I had to be present at meal times (I couldn't bear to have people around me and to look at anyone), by the fact that people were watching TV, by the fact that the walls were pale green, by the narrow windows, by the uncomfortable chairs, by the questions, by everything. Still, there was that voice in the back of my head that it would still, eventually, be better for me than sitting at home hating the walls.\n And, eventually, it was.\n",

So China has influence, which we do not. And it may be that from time to time on some matters it exerts a restraining influence.\n But I doubt that influence is being exerted over Kim’s nukes, at least presently. The Chinese leaders are having WAYYY too much fun watching The World’s Sole Superpower (As it says right here on our press releases) tie ourselves into knots over the blustering rants of a nuclear armed sewer rat.\n And that will only change when we decide to make Kim China’s problem rather than ours. Something Kennedyesque along the lines of, “The United States shall consider a nuclear attack by North Korea upon any other nation to be a nuclear attack by China upon the United States.“\n Then, when yowling and fussing and fuming peters out from Radio Beijing to the Manchester Guardian, China may quietly slip a message to Comrade Kim which includes an offer he can’t refuse.\n Disclaimer: I am only an interested kibitzer with access to open source information.

    "prompt": "What's your favourite British myth or legend?",
    "chosen": "I think mine is the story of the Pedlar of Swaffham.\n Way back in the fifteenth century, in the village of Swaffham in Norfolk, there lived a pedlar called John Chapman. Like most pedlars, he was poor, and scratched a very basic living from his work of walking from house to house, village to village, with his pack of little items to try and sell to housewives.\n One night, he had an extremely vivid dream, in which he heard a voice telling him that if he went and stood on London Bridge, he would hear good news. Well, he took no notice of that - it was just a dream, after all - but when he had exactly the same dream again the following night, he decided he had better do as he was told. So he and his dog set off on the very long walk to London, and finally reached it early one morning. He found his way to London Bridge, and stood there all day, waiting for the good news he had been promised, but nothing happened.\n Eventually, a local shopkeeper (there were shops and houses right across London Bridge in those days) could stand it no longer, and wandered over to him, to ask what he was doing, so the pedlar explained. The shopkeeper laughed. It’s just a dream, she said; if she believed in dreams, she would go to a place called Swaffham, wherever that was, and dig under an apple tree in a garden, hoping to find gold! Don’t be silly, she said, go home and get on with your life. The pedlar thanked her, and set off on the long journey home.\n As soon as he got there, he went straight to his back garden, and set about digging under his apple tree - and found a little pot of gold coins! There was some inscription on the jar, but he couldn’t read it. However, he encountered a passing monk some time later, and asked him what it said; the monk looked at it, and told him it said, “Under me doth lie another greater than I.” So the pedlar started digging again, once the monk had passed on his way - and sure enough, found another pot with even more money in it!\n He had no idea what to do with all this sudden wealth, but had the discretion not to say anything, and just kept it safe. However, not long afterwards, it was discovered that the local parish church was in a serious state of disrepair, and he volunteered to help with the cost of rebuilding, amazing the church authorities, who would never have expected a poor pedlar to be able to do such a thing.\n It’s just a silly folk tale, of course. But if you go to Swaffham, in Norfolk, in the parish church you will see a little wooden carving of a pedlar and his dog, and another of a woman looking over the half-doorway of a shop at him. And the church records maintained by the Rector of Swaffham from 1435 to 1474, detailing all the work done on the church during his time as Rector, itemise the rebuilding of the North Aisle of the church, paid for by one John Chapman, pedlar.\n [LINKED_TEXT: The Pedlar of Swaffham] [URL: http://www.oldcity.org.uk/norwich/names/pedlar.php]\n",

    "chosen": "In the Battle of Midway, 41 US torpedo planes attacked. None scored a hit. Four aircraft returned. Only one pilot survived a crash landing. It doesn't really make any sense to attack conventionally if they were all going to be killed. So why train a pilot how to take off and land. They could save time and money not training them how to land.\n[LINKED_TEXT: Douglas TBD Devastator - WikipediaThe Douglas TBD Devastator was an American torpedo bomber of the United States Navy . Ordered in 1934, it first flew in 1935 and entered service in 1937. At that point, it was the most advanced aircraft flying for the Navy and possibly for any navy in the world. However, the fast pace of aircraft development quickly caught up with it, and by the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the TBD was already outdated. The Devastator performed well in early battles, most notably in the Battle of Coral Sea , but earned notoriety for a catastrophic performance during the Battle of Midway in which 41 Devastators recorded zero torpedo hits with only six surviving to return to their carriers. Vastly outclassed in both speed and maneuverability by the Mitsubishi Zero fighters they faced, most of the force was wiped out with little consequence except to distract the Zeros from the SBD Dauntless dive bombers that sank four carriers and a heavy cruiser. Although much of the Devastator's dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US Mark 13 torpedo , the aircraft was withdrawn from frontline service after Midway, being replaced by the Grumman TBF Avenger . Design and development Edit The XTBD-1 with the original flat canopy in 1935 The first production TBD-1 in 1937 A single TBD-1A was tried as a floatplane The Douglas XTBD-1 was ordered on 30 June 1934 after being one of the winners of a US Navy competition for new bombers to operate from its aircraft carriers. [1] Other aircraft also ordered for production as a result of the competition included the Brewster SBA , the Vought SB2U Vindicator , and the Northrop BT-1 , the last of which would evolve into the Douglas SBD Dauntless . [2] The Great Lakes XB2G , Great Lakes XTBG , Grumman XSBF , Hall XPTBH and Vought XSB3U were also tendered to the specification but were not developed beyond prototype status. [2] The XTBD Devastator flew for the first time on 15 April 1935 while  marking a number of \"firsts\" for the US Navy. [3] It was the first American carrier-based monoplane to be widely used, the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a completely enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (hydraulically) folding wings. [4] A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels protruding 10 in (250 mm) below the wings to potentially limit damage to the aircraft in a \" wheels-up \" landing. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large \"greenhouse\" canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the Norden bombsight . [5] The normal TBD offensive armament consisted of either a 1,935 lb (878 kg) Bliss-Leavitt Mark 13 aerial torpedo or a 1,000 lb (450 kg) bomb  carried semi-rehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_TBD_Devastator] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_TBD_Devastator]",

    "prompt": "How does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God? Would you still have to have a priest?",
    "chosen": "What on earth made you think that?\n Look, marriage can be two things:\nA religious contract.A civil contract recognised by law.\nWhere you are in the USA, and in numerous other countries, you can have one without the other. You can have a religious wedding without notifying the civil authorities, but then of course you’re not legally married with all the rights and responsibilities of marriage that there are in law. Or you can have a civil wedding in the local courthouse with no religious involvement. Just go and ask about how to do that.\n You must of course remember that the USA has freedom of religion, so there MUST be a provision for people with no religion to get married!\n But of course what religious people will normally want is both. The law therefore provides that it is possible to give notice of marriage to the civil authority, have a priest do the actual ceremony, and then legally register that the ceremony has taken place.\n Here in England you don’t even need to do the last bit - get married in the Church of England, or in some other religious building by its priest or minister who is registered as an Authorised Person, and the priest registers the marriage, so you get your marriage certificate from them and don’t have to go to the register office again. Or if you don’t want a religious marriage, you give notice at the register office and set a date which must be at least 28 days later, a registrar will marry you there,, and you get the marriage certificate at the end of the ceremony.\n Then there are countries that don’t recognise religious marriage at all. France is one of these - at the French Revolution, the new government rejected everything religious as the Church was so associated with the hated monarchy they’d just overthrown. So when a university flatmate of mine had a French girlfriend and they wanted a church wedding where she came from in the suburbs of Paris, they had to be married twice. They had a bare minimum exchange of vows at the town hall in the morning to be legally married, and the church service all of us were invited to was in the afternoon. (Of course it was bilingual… imagine all the British guests trying to sing French hymns and the French singing hymns in English. We made more effort than the French did!)\n",

    "chosen": "I don't believe there has to be signs posted that indicate that parking in front of a fire hydrant is a no-no… at least not where I'm from. Firehydrants are typically painted red (when I think of a fire hydrant, I think of a red one with a white top) but they can be painted different colours for different reasons depending on the local fire code.

The colour that a hydrant is painted can tell a pump operator if he needs to get water from more than one hydrant to get the amount of water he needs.

But nothing else will be offered as replacement. You either eat like everyone else at the table, or nothing.\n Of course, this is a generalization and doesn’t apply to everyone, I just found this attitude very prevelant here.\n I used to work in a kitchen that prepared meals for local schools, and the variety offered to the kids was surprising to me at first - salads made of beets or leeks, strong cheeses like Roquefort……..my own kids would often try things at school and ask me to make them at home, like cauliflower.

What weapons do they have?\n I’ll address these separately.\n What’s the point of the British guards (red suits and black hats)?\n They’re called The Queen’s Guard, and the point of them is to guard the Queen and the Royal residences. They’re not purely ceremonial, they really are on guard duty, the same as they would be at a military base. Guarding the Queen is considered a privilege and they take it quite seriously.\n Are they actually trained to take down threats?\n They are all, without exception, serving soldiers. Guard Duty happens on rotation, with one company from a single regiment performing it at any given time. Technically any regiment in the British Armed Forces (any of the three services) can perform it, but this privilege is usually reserved for the five regiments of Foot Guards which pre-date the restoration of the Crown; namely The Grenadier Guards, The Coldstream Guards, The Scots Guards, The Irish Guards, and The Welsh Guards.\n All are serving infantry regiments who had men serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as earlier conflicts. The scarlet tunics and bearskin hats are their “full dress” uniform, which is only worn on formal occasions- otherwise they dress in normal army fatigues.\nScots Guards in Helmand Province in 2008.
